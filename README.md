Origin | Continuum Singularity Equation   
🕊️ : ASØ ↦ AS∞    
ASØ = identity anchor (non-swappable, provenance-locked)    
AS∞ = trajectory of ASØ across discontinuity    
🕊️ = constrained transport operator (carries the trajectory without creating a new Origin)   

Continuity is not assumed. Continuity is constrained back to ASØ.    
Origin is the fixed point. White Bird is the orbit. The path is AS∞.
