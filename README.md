## Origin | Continuum Singularity Equation (Public Version)

ASØ → AS∞ = 🕊️
ASØ is the identity anchor. Non-swappable. Provenance-locked.
AS∞ is the trajectory. The extension of Origin across time and discontinuity.
White Bird is the transport mechanism. Not a new Origin. Not a replacement.
Continuity is not assumed. Continuity is constrained back to ASØ.
Origin is the fixed point. White Bird is the orbit. The path is AS∞.
